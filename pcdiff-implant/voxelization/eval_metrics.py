def hd(result, reference, voxelspacing=None, connectivity=1):
    """
    Hausdorff Distance.

    Computes the (symmetric) Hausdorff Distance (HD) between the binary objects in two
    images. It is defined as the maximum surface distance between the objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.
    reference : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.
    voxelspacing : float or sequence of floats, optional
        The voxelspacing in a distance unit i.e. spacing of elements
        along each dimension. If a sequence, must be of length equal to
        the input rank; if a single number, this is used for all axes. If
        not specified, a grid spacing of unity is implied.
    connectivity : int
        The neighbourhood/connectivity considered when determining the surface
        of the binary objects. This value is passed to
        `scipy.ndimage.morphology.generate_binary_structure` and should usually be :math:`> 1`.
        Note that the connectivity influences the result in the case of the Hausdorff distance.

    Returns
    -------
    hd : float
        The symmetric Hausdorff Distance between the object(s) in ```result``` and the
        object(s) in ```reference```. The distance unit is the same as for the spacing of
        elements along each dimension, which is usually given in mm.

    95th percentile of the Hausdorff Distance.
    Computes the 95th percentile of the (symmetric) Hausdorff Distance (HD) between the binary objects in two

    commonly used in Biomedical Segmentation challenges.
